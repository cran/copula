** TODO [JY] Set up dispexpr (cdf, pdf) for rotExplicitCopula, mixExplicitCopula such that they and khoudrajiCopula work with each other.
** TODO [IK] gofPB(*, ties=TRUE) is *never* tested, *nor* documented (man/gofCopula.Rd); see FIXME, what if x has no ties?
** DONE [MM] warnings about `numDeriv()` to be displayed once per R session and could be suppressed.
** DONE [MM] copula@fullname: *abolish*, i.e., for now *deprecate* and replace by function _describeCop()_ generic & methods
*** DONE [MM] copula@fullname: is used in print() method; Want also use for plotting -- hence urgent for book!
- want to use "it" by default, e.g.,  `main = copula@fullname` in persp() etc, *HOWEVER*
  it is too long / ugly, e.g.,  "Gumbel copula family; Archimedean copula; Extreme value copula"
  contains "copula" *3* times !
*** TODO describeCop() is not good enough for all copulas.
** TODO [MM,MH] qK(p, method="default") is quite inaccurate.  Change default; be smart about "close to 0".
** TODO R/dC-dc.R : switch(class(copula)[1], "normalCopula" = , ....) does *NOT* work when class(copula) *extends*,
 e.g., setClass('nrmCopula', contains="normalCopula")  ... also in othe R/*.R files ?
** TODO How can we extract marginal copulas from a given copula without having to first extract all information (family, parameter) and then defining a new copula? A pretty cool feature would be to simply use dim(copula, ...) <- 2 where '...' specifies (through a vector of variables) which marginal copula is extracted.
** TODO [JY] Debug/fix dCopula for khoudrajiExplicitCopula (dim > 2) when estimate.variance is TRUE
*** DONE Use package Deriv (symbolic derivatives) to obtain pdf from cdf expression of khoudrajiExplicitCopula
*** DONE Use algorithm expressions (deriv) instead of symbolic expressions to speed up
*** TODO Test variance estimation with khoudrajiExplicitCopula
** DONE [IK/JY] Implement Khoudraji copulas (asymCopula()) for 2 'base copulas' (any dimension)
** DONE [IK] modify khoudrajiCopula code to allow construction from any two copulas; have tests (e.g. dCdu implemented?) as method level, not in constructor
** DONE [IK]: review the derivatives expression in dC-dc.R for free parameter adjustment
** TODO Fitting high-dimensional copulas: memory explosion due to allocation of large (d*(d-1)/2) matrix for variance estimators
# See also MH's email from 2016-05-01
We frequently allocate matrices 'var.est' in ./R/fitCopula.R (potentially
elsewhere) for the variance estimators. In larger dimensions, R can be killed by
doing so on multiple platforms (see
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2016-May/072648.html and the discussion
in that thread).

d <- 442
q <- d*(d-1)/2 + 1 # 97462
var.est <- matrix(NA_real_, q, q)

We need to address this. As the thread says, there is little hope to test
beforehand whether for a specific dimension, the matrix of variance estimators
can be allocated. This is what we could/should do:
1) Most functions already have a logical estimate.variance. The problem is that,
   if FALSE, we still try and allocate (+ pass through) a matrix of type
   matrix(NA_real_, q, q) -- which then leads to failure. We should allow the
   validity to simply set var.est (see return objects) to NA in that case.
2) Besides 1), our 'fixed.param' idea should also allow to only compute variance
   estimators for some of the (pairwise) estimators. That could keep the matrix
   small as well.

MH: Apart from the above, .lm.fit() (and possibly getXmat()) is not ideal
MM: (2016-05-03):
    - getXmat() is ok if you do *NOT* use "un"structured Rho.
    - Using the X matrix and lm() or much better .lm.fit() has been a convenience hack (not by me!)
      but has always been *FAR* from a good idea in all but small 'd'
      cases, AFAICS, lm() here is used to compute simple (or possibly weighted)
      means.
** TODO tau()/rho()/lambda() should get 'matrix = TRUE' argument and internally call p2P() to allow to return matrices. lambda() should return a list (at least in d > 2) with two components (lower/upper tail dependence parameters or their matrices). The examples on the help files (e.g. ?tau, ?lambda) should be improved and also address d > 2.
** TODO Improve error message: tCopula(c(rep(0.5, 3), 4), dim = 3, dispstr = "un", df = 4) => should rather say that the *length* of 'param' is not correct (in case one accidentally adds the d.o.f. parameter there as so often)
** TODO [JY]: once 'fixed' stuff added, rewrite/adapt tCopula, tevCopula (so that the 'df.fixed' stuff uses the new 'fixed' stuff) ?
** TODO [MM]: bug? library(copula); pCopula(0.4, copula = normalCopula(param = 0.5, dim = 3)) is *random* !??!!
** DONE [MM]  need a "getTheta" analogously to "setTheta"
 which extracts the parameter (vector) from any copula object
*** DONE partly: we have  getParam() but not exported; should think of name(s)
*** no: setTheta() has more optional args! *Could* replace  new.x <- setTheta(x, value)  by param(new.x) <- value
  but that only make sense when setTheta() has no extra arguments, but it has.
** DONE Clarify C.n() argument issues -- Decision: keep 'X' ('data' not better!!)
** TODO Make rosenblatt() and iRosenblatt() faster by avoiding 'archmCopula' class conversion to 'acopula' and back (see email from 2016-04-20); see the TODO in ./R/gofTrafos.R
** TODO [MM] Is it possible to generate (inheritance) tree class structure with methods automatically from the code ?
** TODO [JY] Clean-up/document "old" copula files (such as ellip*/archm*/ev* copula files); write documentation a la 'Marius' (with Roxygen)
** TODO [JY] Check appropriate position of methods in classes
** TODO Make absdPsi() work for class archmCopula() using nacopula stuff (see TODO in dC-dc.R)
** TODO Figure out and document somewhere how much objects of class archmCopula already use the good old nacopula stuff
- fitCopula() -> loglikCopula() always uses the nacopula slots [all of the 5 AC families in R/fitCopula.R]
** TODO Make more archmCopula stuff use acopula stuff (like pK() doesn't work for archmCopulas!! => we should really have all functionality of acopulas used by archmCopulas! so much 'overhead')
*** TODO rCopula() for archmCopula's should allow to use MH's racopula()
*but* for back compatibility allow *global* options(....) to still get old
random numbers.
*** TODO The NAC Archimedean families are partly 'better' and partly "worse" than archmCop: need 'uscore'
*** TODO JY: For score & uscore (see [[file:feature-table.org][Feature table]]); write testing code
based on IJ-"papers" that compares the two classes numerically.
*** TODO d=2 is special: allows negative tau, MH-code now does partly.
 done for Clayton, Frank, AMH.  BUT not for the R/cop_objects.R slots
*** DONE MM: pCopula(<archm>) and dCopula(<archm>)
use the the numerically good formulae rather than the "exprDist".
** TODO [MM + MH] implement fitting of NACs with fixed structure (how is it done in the R package 'HAC'?)
** TODO [MM + MH] function(outer_nacopula) -> matrix of 'comp' (in {1:d})
which corresponds to the different sectors.
This can be used, e.g., for building a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or
for estimation purposes etc. Note: look at nacPairthetas
** DONE Shall fitCopula.ml(, method="mpl") call pobs()?  A: _NO_; had to finalize for the book.
MH:
At the moment, fitCopula.ml(, method="mpl") requires data in
[0,1]^d. We could actually allow general data from IR^d for this
method and then internally apply pobs(). The main advantage is that
this would be more fail-safe for users (a user currently gets an error
if the data is not in [0,1]^d, but that doesn't guarantee that the
data are pobs()...). A "technical" drawback is that when called from
gofPB() or gofMB() (time critical), pobs() is called a bit more often
than necessary; however, since we always call fitCopula() with
estimate.variance=FALSE from gofCopula(), it actually makes no sense
to call fitCopula(, "mpl") [although you can choose to do so if you
like] so one could simply call fitCopula(, "ml") then to avoid the
additional pobs() evaluations. One "conceptual" drawback is this: in
the whole file fitCopula.R, we never call pobs() -- it's always left
to the reader. So implementing it in fitCopula.ml(, method="mpl")
would 'contradict' that. Really not sure... I tend to say the
advantage outweighs the drawbacks... What do you think?
** TODO We seem to have quite a few 'deprecated' statements in the package (should be fine to remove some of the old stuff by now!)
** TODO [MM + MH] Colors for book, coPal() in Sweave-prelim.R) --> part of copula package.
*** we already have heatHCLgap() in R/pairsRosenblatt.R --- export and generalize where needed to defined
   Continuous/monotone color palettes -- via short function calls -->
   vector of colors (use either in palette() for col=<n>, *or* more
   frequently as  cols = *  argument, whenever needed in the book.
** DONE rhoTCopula not valid! => should define rho* and irho* only for Gauss copula!
** DONE [IK] Improve warning message in dC-dc.R when numerical stuff is used (provide the copula name!)
** DONE [IK] make method = "Rd" work with all the sim = "mult" families
** DONE [IK] clean-up test functions
** DONE [IK] Document dC-dc.R
** DONE [IK] Implement copula rotations (rotCopula()); mostly done incl tests/rotCopula-ex.R
** TODO [IK] Write test code for mult gof Sn, Rn
** DONE Implement copula mixtures (mixCopula()) with sufficiently flexible structure so that we can maybe estimate the probability weights in the future
** DONE [JY] document getL() a bit more in fitCopula.R (what is it for?); there's a TODO there as well (in the header of getL())
** TODO introduce "empiricalCopula" (or "empCopula") as new subclass of "Copula" (not "copula")
   and maybe *additionally* "empiricalDist" / "empMvdc", inheriting from
   new "Mvdc" which would contain "mvdc" and "empMvdc".
   -> nice persp() {and maybe contour()} method via perspCopula(*, fun=C.n, ....) and
      perspMvdc(*, fun=F.n, ....). ---> man/Mvdc.Rd and R/graphics.R
** DONE [MM] print(summary(<fitCop>)) prints *less* than print(.): not R like; -> R/fitCopula.R summary.fitCopula
** DONE make print(fitCopula()) nicer by omitting the (theoretical meaningless) p-values
** TODO [MM] pCopula(u,..) and dCopula(u,..) should work for u outside [0,1]^d  & NA/NaN
*** TODO both should keep NA & NaN. Maybe keep them different, as  pnorm(c(2,NA,NaN));
however relax, as  NA+NaN or NaN+NA  differ, too.
*** DONE for pCopula(): using  u[] <- pmax(0, pmin(1, u))  {subtlety!}
*** DONE dCopula() = 0 {log = -Inf} for u "outside"
** TODO [MM] why does onacopulaL("Clayton", *) work, but onacopulaL("clayton",*) does not?
Specifically,
   onacopulaL("Clayton", list(th=iTau(archmCopula("clayton"), tau=0.5), seq_len(3)))
works but
   onacopulaL("clayton", list(th=iTau(archmCopula("clayton"), tau=0.5), seq_len(3)))
doesn't.  Note the 2nd  "clayton", i.e. as arg to archmCopula(.) it _does_ work.
 => essentially, we always want to use the capitalized versions, but it might
    still be a bug that it doesn't work otherwise
** TODO [all 4] Renaming of current "base" functions see [[file:feature-table.org][Feature table]] and [[file:do-now.org][do-now table]]

*** TODO dCdthetaEvCopula() cannot work (as dAdtheta() has no methods) and is used nowhere
** TODO Exporting/Documenting of "internal" functions:
*** DONE => C.n(). JY: Ivan, I think we should export an empCopula function. I always
thought it was unnecessary because it can be obtained with R package mecdf.
But people have asked for it.
*** Also, look at ./man/copula-internal.Rd :
*** no longer TODO: schlatherCopula:  JY: The implementation of schlatherCopula is not ready for release.
More ev copulas will come from max-stable processes.
** TODO why not make fitCopula more work like a 'method' (adapt to the copula class in an easier way)
** TODO fitCopula() should encompass all methods of enacopula() (similar to fitCopula.itau.mpl)
** DONE [MM] data(rdj) should have a "Date" in column 1, not a factor !
** TODO [MM + MH] implement estimation of standard error for fitCopula.itau.mpl
** TODO see TODO in R/tCopula.R : npar.ellip() function;-> nparam(); test pos.def.
** TODO tCopula() / normalCopula() allow alternative specification of cor.matrix at least for the "un" dispersion structure
** TODO opower() and GIG --> either produce acopula with parameter *vector*, or
--- maybe in any case ---
produce an object of class 'opacopula' ("outer power Archimedean copula")
which is just 'acopula' with a new show method ("thetabase" at least!),
possibly a new slot ...
Longer term: want to *estimate* those correctly [MLE at least].
** TODO R/fitCopula.R : method="itau" & "irho": parallelize double for-loop in
 fitKendall() & fitSpearman() :  tests/moments.R must
 check that vectorized iTau() and iRho() work for all families
** TODO MM, MH: indepTest()  takes a while {ok}, *BUT* cannot be interrupted (quickly enough)
    - shouldn't it {and all other tests} return a (valid) object of class
    "htest" (maybe "htest" in addition to the specific S3 class)?
    --> we would probably not need extra print() methods, and just use print.htest()
** DONE [MM/JY]: Add slot 'fixed' (or similar) to copula class, change constructors of existing classes accordingly
 and make appropriate changes in fitCopula() (and gofCopula() if required and do basic checks)
** DONE fix: ellipCopula("normal") works (=> param = NA_real_), but ellipCopula("normal", param = NA) fails: MM because NA is logical
** DONE use sinpi() etc e.g. in R/ellipCopula.R
** DONE New Wrapper functions or rather extending one or the other function names
*** DONE dcopula(), pcopula(), rcopula()  (for "nacopula")

** DONE Ivan: Document xvCopula()

** DONE 'hideWarnings' now in fitMvdc(): Not sink(), change it to use suppressWarnings() the same as fitCopula!
** DONE 'hideWarnings' in fitCopula()
- change default to FALSE
- use within fitCopula() instead of fitCopula.ml() and fitCopula.itau.mpl()
- update ?fitCopula (and other locations?) accordingly
** DONE fitCopula() for 2-dim tCopula() *AND* 2-dim tevCopula(); latter clearly fails
** DONE mvdc() -- fitMvdc() and generate data from fit:
 - fitMvdc()@mvdc  must contain the *fitted* parameters, the same as
   fitCopula()@copula does already.
** DONE rPosStable() is "wrong", actually just rstable1() *scaled* unusually
   --> use rstable1() [unless options(..) for back compatibility]
** DONE no longer try() in loglikCopula()
  - "hideWarnings" seems "wrong by design", there.
  - *However* fitCopula() now uses 'hideWarnings' (again): should *not*
    report warnings by default: They are too disturbing for 'Joe Average'
    fitCopula() user.
** DONE tryCatch() in loglikMvdc(), but not longer hideWarnings there.
   OTOH,

** DONE largely improve on gofTests.R: should be made more modular, so that users can provide functions for the parametric bootstrap (gofPB) and the multiplier boostrap (gofMB). Furthermore, checking and documentation have to be improved (see already improved gofPB());
** DONE deprecate gnacopula() [see 'Note' there!!!]
 MH: already 'prepared' a lot; only difficulty: many calls of gnacopula()
 => ideally, the checks should be done with gofCopula() instead of gnacopula()!!!!
** DONE persp(), contour() should work with pCopula / dCopula.
** DONE getAcop(gumbelCopula()) should work

pspline changes ...}.
JY: Sorry for having to use this. The objects stored here are used to
return Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho and their inverse functions
for copulas for which explicit formulas are not available. We used
simulation over a grid of (possibly transformed) parameter values
and smoothed the results with pspline. Some details can be found
in the appendix of Kojadinovic and Yan (2010, IME). The R scripts
that generated sysdata.rda were moved out of the package source.
We can put them back. The best place is under inst?
